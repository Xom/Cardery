<p>Here's how I enabled and configured Internet Information Services (IIS) on Windows 7 for localhost use with Cardery.<br>(IIS is the web server made by Microsoft.)</p>
<p>First I went to Control Panel → Programs and Features → Turn Windows features on or off, and checked "Internet Information Services" and "URL Authorization", as shown:</p>
<p><img src="enable.png"></p>
<p>Then I opened the IIS Manager and went to IP Address and Domain Restrictions.</p>
<p><img src="run.png"> <img src="inetmgr.png"></p>
<p>In the pane on the right, I clicked "Edit Feature Settings..." and set "Access for unspecified clients" to "Deny".<br>Then (also on the right), I clicked "Add Allow Entry..." and added an entry to allow requests from 127.0.0.1.</p>

<p>Then from the manager home page I went to "Output Caching". I added entries to "Prevent all caching" for all the file extensions I could think of.</p>

<p>Then I renamed and changed the default website to point to my Cardery folder.</p>

<p>Then on the right I went to "Edit Permissions..." to open the folder properties, Security tab, "Edit..." to open folder permissions and "Add..." the group "IIS_IUSRS".</p>

<p>Then I went to Sites → Cardery → Authentication, and clicked "Edit..." for the "Anonymous Authentication" entry to change it to "Application pool identity" which was for some reason needed in order not to get Access Denied when I tried to visit the site.</p>

<p>I think that's all the steps I did. Hopefully I didn't forget anything.</p>
